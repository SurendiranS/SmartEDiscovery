Dear Conference Organizer,

I am writing to confirm my attendance at the upcoming marketing conference scheduled for September 10th and 11th. I have completed the registration process and have booked my accommodations accordingly.

Please let me know if there are any additional details or requirements that I need to be aware of prior to the conference. I am looking forward to the event and the opportunity to learn from industry experts.

Best regards,
Emily
