Dear Manager,

I hope this email finds you well. I would like to request vacation leave from August 15th to August 30th. During this period, I will be out of the office for personal reasons and will not have access to my work email.

I have discussed my absence with the team, and they are aware of any pending tasks that need to be delegated. If there are any urgent matters that require my attention before or after my vacation, please let me know in advance.

Thank you for your understanding. I will ensure that my responsibilities are properly handed over before my departure.

Best regards,
Michael
