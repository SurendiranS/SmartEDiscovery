Hi John,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to provide you with an update on the current status of the project.

We have successfully completed Phase 1, and the deliverables have been sent to the client for review. We are now moving forward with Phase 2, which involves conducting user testing and finalizing the design.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further information. I'm available for a call if needed.

Best regards,
Emily
