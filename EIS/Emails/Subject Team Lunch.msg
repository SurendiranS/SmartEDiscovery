Hi everyone,

It's been a busy month, and I believe it's time to have a team lunch to unwind and enjoy some quality time together. I've booked a table at the restaurant near our office for next Friday at 1:00 PM.

Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or preferences, so I can inform the restaurant in advance. Looking forward to a fun and relaxing lunch with all of you!

Best regards,
David
